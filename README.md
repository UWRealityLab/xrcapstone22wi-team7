# Extreme Red Light Green Light - xrcapstone22wi-team7
Players race to the finish line by running, jumping, climbing, and rowing while trying to avoid moving when all lights turn red. 
The game ends when the first player (or bot) reaches the end.

Do note the game tends to freeze up a bit when joining/creating a room. Please be patient :)
